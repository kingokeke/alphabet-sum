# Words that sum up to hundred

This is my implementation of a solution to a problem I encountered in a Whatsapp group I am a member of. Another member spoke of an interview question he once was asked.

#Question:

Assuming that the letters of the English alplabet were mapped to numbers representing their position in the alphabet such that a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 and so on until z = 26, 
write a function that returns all the words in the English language for which the sum of their individual letters equals 100. Examples include "Wednesday" and "Attitude".
